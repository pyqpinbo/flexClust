\title{Generate B-Spline Basis and Derivatives}
\usage{
rspline(t, t0, m, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A numeric vector of observed data points where the B-spline basis is evaluated.}

\item{t0}{A numeric vector of target points where the B-spline basis and derivatives are evaluated.}

\item{m}{An integer specifying the order of the B-spline basis (degree + 1). For example, \code{m = 4} represents cubic splines.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of internal knots to use for the B-spline.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{Bt}{A matrix representing the B-spline basis evaluated at \code{t0}.}
\item{B1t}{A matrix representing the first-order derivatives of the B-spline basis evaluated at \code{t0}.}
}
\description{
Constructs B-spline basis and their first-order derivatives for given input points,
using specified order, internal knots, and boundary constraints.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The function computes a set of B-spline basis functions and their derivatives evaluated at the points \code{t0}.
\item The knot sequence is constructed using quantiles of \code{t} and boundary knots slightly beyond the range of \code{t}.
\item The resulting matrices are reordered to match the original order of \code{t0}.
}
}
\examples{
t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
t0 <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 10)
result <- rspline(t, t0, m = 4, k = 5)
Bt <- result$Bt
B1t <- result$B1t
